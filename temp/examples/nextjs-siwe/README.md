# [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [SIWE](https://login.xyz/) + ConnectKit Example

This is a simple example of how to implement ConnectKit with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [SIWE](https://docs.family.co/connectkit/authentication) in TypeScript. This example is based on the [SIWE with Next.js documentation](https://docs.family.co/connectkit/auth-with-nextjs) provided by Family.

## Running the example

- Have a look at the [instructions in the main README](https://github.com/family/connectkit/blob/main/README.md#running-examples-locally)
- Please copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the values
- You'll want to set up an environment variable called `SESSION_SECRET` â€” a randomly generated, strong password of at least 32 characters
